## Description

This is a starter template for Vite, Vue 3, TailwindCSS, and Firebase web applications. Vue router is also included in this template. Although, there's no state management package included in this template, Vue 3 comes with Composition API, which I think is more than enough.

If you want to use this template, feel free to do so. No need to ask for permission or whatnot.

:information_source: Read the [instructions](#instructions) below for more details.

## Motivation

I find myself spending a lot of time initializing starter files every time I want to take on a side project, that's the main reason why I created this template. I hope this also helps you as it did to me.
